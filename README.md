## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Ahmad Syafiq Kamil. Currently, I'm an engineer at BRIN with a strong passion for tech innovation. My focus is shifting towards Web3 development, particularly in backend systems.

With hands-on expertise in Python, Solidity, and machine learning, Iâ€™m eager to push the boundaries of what's possible in the decentralized web.

Iâ€™m proud of my ability to lead teams, think critically under pressure, and adapt quickly to ever-evolving technologies. I believe in leveraging these skills to create impactful solutions in the Web3 space.

Feel free to send me a DM if youâ€™re looking to collaborate or discuss potential opportunities!
